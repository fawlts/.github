### 👋 Hey, this is FAWLTS!
-----
FAWLTS is an NGO that bridges the gap between schools and the job market, helping students understand what they want to do when they grow up and equipping them with critical cross-disciplinary skills, ultimately contributing to reduce the incidence of NEET among under 30s. We do this by supporting the establishment and growth of Alumni Communities around their former high schools.
